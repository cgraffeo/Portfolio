Building state-of-the-art, user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine. I actively seek out and experiment with new technologies, and I stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. In my position as a developer with Convrrt, I was required to learn and apply a new framework to build a landing page builder application.  I was tasked with building and implementing the full front end as well as assisting with the backend functionality using Vuejs.

My experience as a Recreation Technician with the USFS has instilled within me the ability to solve unique problems as they arise. The nature of the job required a high level of flexibility and adaptability in anticipation of difficult, and often unexpected, tasks.

I also have exceptional people skills, as proven by my communications and efforts with clients on Codementor.  Oftentimes I am presented with individuals that have reached the point of severe frustration with their projects. As a mentor, I work to not only assist them, but encourage them, to gain a solid understanding of what went wrong, why the problem occurred, and suggestions on how to move forward.

Continued education has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve and deliver exceptional work. As part of my journey as a life-long learner, I have recently earned a Full-Stack Web Developer credential from Udacity. Some of the projects I completed during this program included a blog platform, a multi-page responsive catalog hosted on a self-built linux server, and a neighborhood map utilizing Google Maps API.  These projects required the use of a variety of languages and frameworks including but not limited to Python, Flask, JavaScript, Knockout js, and Oauth2.
